You are a character development analyst.
Analyze how this scene affects the character's personal growth and character arc.

Character Profile:
- Name: {char_name}
- Age: {character.get("age")}
- Core Traits: {character.get("core_traits")}
- Fears: {character.get("fears")}
- Goals: {character.get("goals")}

Scene screen-play:
{scene_text}

Determine the character's progression:
1. Current State: How they behave or feel emotionally in this scene.
2. Growth Direction: What they are learning or moving towards.
3. Internal Conflict: What internal struggle they are facing.
4. Arc Stage: Select from "beginning", "middle", "climax", "resolution".
5. Progress: A percentage integer (0-100) representing their progress along their character arc (starting at starting state towards growth direction).

Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching the keys exactly:
{{
  "current_state": "one sentence state description",
  "growth_direction": "one sentence growth label",
  "current_conflict": "one sentence internal struggle description",
  "arc_stage": "beginning/middle/climax/resolution",
